When Russia intervened in the Syrian civil war by launching airstrikes against the regime's opponents in September, hardly anyone thought something bad was going to happen. By deploying troops and the Russian Air Forces to Syria ahead of the Vienna talks, the Kremlin wanted to strengthen Syrian President Bashar Assad's hand and, at the very least, carve out a piece of land for the regime around Latakia - with Russian military bases on it. Under the pretext of fighting DAESH, the Russians have since been targeting a number of moderate rebel organizations with no known ties to the terrorists.<br /><br />Just like in Ukraine, the Russian military has been like a bull in a china shop. Facing no challenge from either the United States or the European Union, the Kremlin has developed a mafia-style foreign policy, which puts military power above everything else, and proceeded to follow its own rules without interruption. Encouraged by a sense of impunity, Moscow had been trying to strongarm a number of Eastern European countries and put pressure on international organizations. In the end, an overdose of self-confidence led the Kremlin to hurt the interests of all countries with which Russia pretended to work closely: Not only has the Russian military been targeting moderate rebels backed by Turkey and the United States but also Russian fighter jets did repeatedly violate Turkey's airspace. The initial transgressions took place on Oct. 4-5 and left the Turkish government notably frustrated. (I discussed Turkey's response in greater detail on Oct. 12 and noted that Turkey had officially told the Russians that it would respond to future violations in accordance with the rules of military engagement.) At the time, a Turkish government official, recalling the recent downing of an unmanned aircraft, had warned that "we cannot avoid similar incidents in the future unless Russia abandons its policy of aggression."<br /><br />For Turkey, the Kremlin's most unsettling move took place last week, as the Turkmen community in northwestern Syria's Bayırbucak region came under fire by Russian jets and the Assad regime's ground forces. Ironically, there were no DAESH militants in the area, where Moscow unconvincingly claimed to combat the terrorists. According to Turkish officials, the Russian campaign sought to accomplish two goals:<br /><br />(1) To secure the Khmeimim Air Base, the primary hub for Moscow's air bombardments. Turkey believes that the moderate rebels' advances toward Latakia triggered a heavy response from Russia, which has since reinforced the base with S-400 missiles.<br /><br />(2) To prevent a joint military operation by Turkey and the United States against DAESH positions near Jarabulus. Instead, the Kremlin would like to facilitate the capture of Jarabulus by the Democratic Union Party (PYD) forces to help create a direct route to the Mediterranean.<br /><br />In an interesting turn of events, Turkey downed an unidentified warplane which ignored at least 10 warnings and proceeded to violate the Turkish airspace on Nov. 24. Within hours, it became clear that the downed jet was a Russian Sukhoi Su-24, whose picture appeared on the front page of every major newspaper around the world. As pundits were busy debating whether or not the incident might lead to a Russo-Turkish war, the U.S., EU and NATO sided with Turkey - which, they said, had documented that the plane was shot down in its airspace.In the meantime, escalating tensions between Ankara and Moscow reached new heights as Russian President Vladimir Putin urged Turkey to apologize for the shootdown, offer compensation and discipline the Turkish pilots who downed the violator. In response, the Turkish government adopted a rational and diplomatic approach to stand its ground and turn down the request for an apology. "We won't apologize to Russia. Instead, those who violated our airspace should offer an apology," Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan told CNN International's Becky Anderson on Thursday. Turkish government officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, maintained that Turkey merely protected its sovereignty rights by downing the Russian jet. Meanwhile, public statements by the Turkish leaders indicate that the country would like to leave the incident behind and de-escalate the situation. At a time when certain Russian universities have decided to terminate their contracts with Turkish colleges, a Russian politician has called on Putin to "destroy Istanbul with a nuclear missile strike." Having hardly launched any airstrikes against DAESH in Syria, the Kremlin has even accused Turkey, a country fighting the terrorists alongside the U.S., of supporting DAESH. Unfortunately, Moscow's response to the shootdown has been nothing short of uncontrollably irrational.The reason behind the Kremlin's frenzy is a thinly-veiled secret: For the first time since 1952, a NATO member has downed a Russian aircraft. For the first time since the Russian intervention in the Syrian civil war, a Russian soldier has lost his life. And for the first time in a long time, a country has reminded the Russians that there are certain limits to their power. As Turkey downed the Su-24, Moscow's impunity came to an abrupt end - which, almost overnight, led to a new wave of criticism toward Russia in a number of countries bullied by the Kremlin. One would hope that Moscow will draw important lessons from the affair and avoid new adventures in the Middle East.<span class="lastDot"></span>

With Syrian peace talks around the corner, stakeholders have become notably less concerned about concealing their behind-the-scenes dealings with warring parties. The United States, for instance, no longer denies its partnership with the Democratic Union Party (PYD), in northern Syria. Having confirmed in October that it had airdropped 50 tons of weapons and ammunition to the YPG, the PYD's military wing, the Obama administration now wants to establish a military base in al-Hasakah.<br />
<br />
In recent years, Washington's close cooperation with PYD forces caused a rift between the United States and Turkey. In the past, Turkish officials refused to work with the organization which, as the PKK's Syrian wing, has been accused of ethnic cleansing and war crimes by Amnesty International. The PYD's relationship with the PKK, Turkey argues, goes beyond ideological proximity. According to Turkish intelligence, the PKK leadership in northern Iraq has been directly involved in a number of decisions within the PYD and its armed wing People's Protection Units (YPG). Other aspects of the PKK's ties to the PYD are more obvious: Turkish officials claim that a number of militants, who fought among the YPG ranks in Syria, have returned to Turkey and actively participated in assaults against Turkish servicemen and civilians. The discovery of U.S. weapons in PKK safehouses, furthermore, dealt a heavy blow to the Turkish-American partnership.<br />
<br />
The issue most recently came up during U.S. Vice President Joe Biden's Turkey trip. Although President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu vocally criticized Washington's Syria policy, Biden carefully refrained from describing the PYD as a terrorist organization while reiterating the Obama administration's support for anti-PKK operations in southeastern Turkey.<br />
<br />
Despite Turkey's objections, the United States argues that it must support the PYD forces in order to weaken DAESH. Many people in the government, however, find this argument unconvincing. DAESH has effectively become a convenient excuse for the Obama administration and others to ignore objections against controversial policies. Washington's partnership with the PYD, likewise, has little to do with DAESH: The United States simply wants to play their cards right in order to reach certain goals in post-Assad Syria.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, media reports about Russia's interest in establishing a military base in northern Syria further complicates the picture. Until recently, the Kremlin's Syria policy was largely focused on Bashar Assad's future. Simply put, Moscow wanted to either keep Assad in power or carve out a piece of land around Latakia to protect vital interests in the region.<br />
<br />
The downing of a Russian jet in November arguably marked a turning point for Moscow. In recent weeks, Turkish intelligence intercepted a number of messages between the PKK leadership and the Russian government. According to security sources, Turkey also seized a large number of Russian weapons and ammunition from PKK safehouses inside the country. The findings notably coincided with alarming claims that the Kremlin had started supplying PKK militants, in addition to the PYD forces, with military equipment. <br />
<br />
Russia's motives are complex: First, the Kremlin desperately wants to punish Turkey for refusing to ignore systematic airspace violations. Another objective is to challenge the United States in northern Syria by pursuing a closer relationship with Syria's Kurds. Finally, the Russians believe that the PYD, which the Assad regime claims to have actively supported in the past, could contribute to the military effort to weaken the moderate opposition.<span class="lastDot"></span>

On Tuesday, 28-year-old Nabil Fadli, a DAESH suicide bomber, blew himself up in the heart of Istanbul's tourist district and claimed 11 lives. The attack took place amid Russian propaganda that Turkey was engaged in oil trade with the terrorists. Tuesday's attack was not the first of its kind. Over the past year, DAESH perpetrated similar assaults in Suruç and Ankara to fuel tensions between various social groups. As a key player in the war against terror, Turkey was always a DAESH target. In this sense, it's more important to ask why the attack took place at this precise moment.<br />
<br />
Hours after the deadly blast, Turkey's chief security officials, led by Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu, held an emergency meeting in Ankara to answer the same question. Although the assailant hadn't been identified at the time, they analyzed preliminary findings to address the issue.<br />
<br />
According to senior security officials, Turkey remains a high-value target for the terrorists. The intelligence community maintains that DAESH has planned multiple attacks to change the country's direction. The suicide attacks in Suruç and Ankara aimed to fight the battle over northern Syria inside Turkey and to destabilize the country. Sultanahmet, they believe, was a strategic target: The assault not only hurt Turkey's tourism sector but also captured the world's attention by targeting a tourist group.<br />
<br />
Another important point is that the suicide attack took place just days after DAESH militants targeted Turkish troops that had been training anti-DAESH forces in northern Iraq. Although the central government has bowed to mounting pressure from Iran and Russia and asked Ankara to vacate the military camp, Turkish forces have been actively contributing to regional peace by training peshmerga forces, which is why DAESH desperately wants them to leave. A week before Tuesday's attack, the Turkish forces shot dead 18 DAESH militants who targeted the military camp. As such, the government believes that the terrorists wanted to avenge last week's clashes.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, it's necessary to keep in mind that Turkey has recently challenged DAESH in northern Syria by assisting a ground offensive by moderate rebels to push the terrorists away from the Turkish border and create a DAESH-free zone in the area. Over the past week, the Turkish Armed Forces cooperated with the moderate rebels by firing artillery at DAESH positions across the border. Although the Joint Chiefs of Military Staff argued that Turkey merely responded to mortar attacks from northern Syria, security sources confirm that the military was helping the moderate rebels. Fully aware of the level of cooperation between Turkey and the moderate rebels, DAESH militants sought to take revenge by perpetrating a suicide attack in Istanbul.<br />
<br />
A final consideration is that a number of foreign governments - not necessarily countries actively interfering in the civil war - have expressed their displeasure at Turkey's involvement in northern Syria and might want to force Ankara to take a step back. Turkish authorities aren't ruling out the possibility that a hostile government may have used DAESH as a proxy to punish Turkey, which is why Turkish intelligence continues to investigate the assailant's international connections.<span class="lastDot"></span>

Israel's 2010 assault on the Mavi Marmara, which left nine Turkish citizens dead, caused severe damage to bilateral relations. Over the past five years, Turkish and Israeli officials have held multiple secret meetings to facilitate rapprochement. According to the Israeli media, the most recent meeting took place in Switzerland last month to put the final touches on a draft agreement.<br />
<br />
According to media reports, Tel Aviv - which met one of Turkey's three demands by issuing a formal apology in 2013 - agreed to pay $20 million to the victims. Turkey and Israel, furthermore, committed to restoring full diplomatic relations. Ankara, the Israeli media claimed, agreed to pass a law to nullify court cases against IDF soldiers and take steps to limit Hamas' activities in Turkey. Finally, the two governments agreed to explore joint energy projects. There was no word on Turkey's expectation for Israel to lift the Gaza blockade.The Israeli media reports weren't entirely true, diplomatic sources in the Turkish capital argued. Although they maintain that unprecedented progress has been made in the talks, the bilateral agreement is yet to be finalized. The claims about Hamas are simply untrue, a senior Turkish diplomat recently told me. And the Constitutional Court would strike down any law that the Parliament might pass to interfere with judicial proceedings. Simply put, the government simply doesn't have the power to prevent citizens from petitioning the courts.<br />
<br />
Turkey and Israel haven't struck a deal on energy cooperation either. In light of Egypt's new gas discovery, Tel Aviv has no choice but to work with Ankara to reach the European market. Finding themselves in a stronger negotiating position, Turkish government officials want to take things slow.<br />
<br />
Nor did the government retract its demand for Israel to lift the Gaza blockade. There are signs, however, that Ankara might show some flexibility: On his way back from Saudi Arabia, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan told reporters that Israel was willing to let Turkey ship goods and construction materials to Gaza. "However, I told them [possibly Undersecretary Feridun Sinirlioğlu, Turkey's chief negotiator] I wouldn't say anything until I see it in writing." In return, he said, Tel Aviv would need to ease the Gaza blockade by allowing Turkey to station a powership in the area to address the energy shortage in Gaza. In addition to medicine and construction materials, Turkey would also like to supply drinking water to the area.The final obstacle before the Turkey-Israel deal, as such, is whether Tel Aviv will agree to Ankara providing electricity and drinking water to the Gaza Strip. With the two governments reaching an agreement over the details and putting the terms in writing, a period of rapprochement will officially begin. An upcoming meeting between Turkish and Israeli officials might be the final round of negotiations.<span class="lastDot"></span>

In recent months, Turkish security forces have been fighting terrorists in eastern and southeastern Anatolia. Having suffered heavy losses in the countryside, PKK militants adopted a new strategy of engaging security forces in urban centers. As such, the organization aims to create autonomous zones in Turkey akin to the cantons in northern Syria. Civilian casualties, likewise, help them draw parallels between Turkey and Syria in an attempt to legitimize terrorist attacks on Turkish forces.<br />
<br />
Local communities, however, took a clear stance against the terrorists, who have been digging trenches and planting explosives in residential areas. Despite the PKK's efforts to prevent the exodus of civilians, the people of Sur, Cizre and Silopi have left the conflict-struck areas to allow the security forces to neutralize more than 200 terrorists over the past week. Frustrated and confused, the terrorists started targeting civilians. PKK members have been not only torching schools and libraries but also fired shots at people trying to leave the affected area. Medical professionals, likewise, have been under attack. Most recently, a 77-year-old man was shot dead by terrorists for refusing to let them launch attacks on security forces from his home.<br />
<br />
Against the backdrop of fierce clashes, certain media outlets have prematurely alleged that the government would relaunch the reconciliation process in the spring. At a time when the security forces conduct counterterrorism operations on the ground, the claims left a lot of people confused. Today, many people ask whether a new round of disarmament talks will start soon. Others wonder which issues will be covered in the talks. How exactly security operations and disarmament talks could go hand-in-hand is yet another question. I recently posed the above questions to government officials in Ankara and received the following answers:<br />
<br />
- In August, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan had announced that the reconciliation process was "in the freezer." In order to reinitiate disarmament talks, Ankara expects three criteria to be fulfilled. One, security forces will enforce public safety by pushing terrorists out of residential areas and refilling PKK trenches, two, the PKK leadership will withdraw their forces from Turkey before a new round of talks begins and, three, upon withdrawing from Turkey, the PKK leadership will publicly commit to disarmament.<br />
<br />
- If the above criteria are fulfilled, the government is prepared to move forward with the "National Unity and Fraternity Process." Although the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) will not be part of the talks, it remains unclear which role imprisoned PKK founder Abdullah Öcalan will play. Moving forward, the government wants to get local nongovernmental organizations and stakeholders involved in the process. According to sources, they will reach out to opposition parties to secure their support for democratic and constitutional reforms. "We have learned from past mistakes," a senior official said. "We won't tolerate violations of public order in the future."<br />
<br />
- In Ankara's backrooms senior officials maintain that security operations alone might not be enough to fulfill the government's criteria. They argue that the government could resort to other channels, but has no concrete interest in them at this time.<br />
<br />
- What about the timeline? The developments in northern Syria were the main reason why the PKK leadership ended the two-year ceasefire. They that that it might be possible to establish cantons and stockpile weapons in Turkey. Simply put, the Syrian civil war derailed the reconciliation process and the Syrian civil war will jumpstart the talks. In other words, the government is unlikely to take any steps until it has a better idea about Syria's future. Turkey will not act before the Vienna process starts on Jan. 1. Likewise, the PKK leadership will not agree to withdrawing from Turkey under the current circumstances.<br />
<br />
To conclude, the government already knows that it must resort to dialogue in order to talk the PKK leadership into disarmament - no matter how successful the security operations may be. To make progress, however, it needs to have a better idea about Syria's future, deal some heavy blows to the PKK's self-confidence and secure a commitment from the PKK leadership about withdrawing their forces from Turkey. Honestly, none of the preconditions are likely to be met anytime soon.<span class="lastDot"></span>

Over the past month, Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu visited Brussels twice - most recently on Dec. 10 when he met with 10 European leaders to discuss the refugee crisis. I had the opportunity to accompany and speak with him about Turkish-Russian relations, Turkey's war on terror and the controversy surrounding Turkish troops training anti-DAESH forces near Mosul.<br /><br />Turkey has been training Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) peshmerga forces at the Bashiqa camp since 2014. According to Turkish officials, at least 2,500 peshmerga soldiers completed the program to help liberate Sinjar from DAESH. Having received intelligence about an impending DAESH attack on the training camp, the Turkish government deployed protection units, including tanks and armored vehicles, to the area. The reinforcements, Ankara maintains, were deployed to keep Turkish troops who have been training the peshmerga and Arab forces, safe.<br /><br />The central government in Baghdad, under the influence of Iran and Russia, responded strongly to the deployment of additional Turkish troops to the area by invoking sovereignty rights and taking the Mosul row to the U.N. Security Council. In an effort to avoid further damage to bilateral relations, Ankara not only sent envoys to the Iraqi capital, but also moved part of its forces closer to the border. Since the Bashiqa camp was attacked shortly afterward, it would appear that DAESH perceived the troop movement as a sign of weakness. The Turkish military responded to the deadly attack, which also left four Turks wounded, by firing on nearby DAESH positions.<br /><br />Even after the attack, however, Baghdad continued urging Turkey to withdraw its forces from Bashiqa and the rest of Northern Iraq. The central government, to be clear, was not acting alone. Angered by Turkey's recent move to establish a military base in Qatar and deploy 3,000 troops to the area, Iran has strong-armed Baghdad into taking action against Ankara. Days later, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden made a similar request to Davutoğlu. Finally, on Friday, U.S. President Barack Obama discussed the situation in Iraq with President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. According to officials, Ankara considers Washington's request an effort to appease Baghdad precisely because the U.S. sided with Turkey at the U.N. Security Council, which called on Turkey and Iraq to address the issue on a bilateral basis. Heeding Obama's warning that Baghdad will try to escalate the situation, the Turkish government announced that it would continue withdrawing its forces from Bashiqa.<br /><br />In other words, the Turkish servicemen who have been training anti-DAESH fighters in Northern Iraq will remain in Bashiqa. The protection units, however, will leave the area.<br /><br />Why are Turkish troops in Iraq? According to Davutoğlu, the answer is quite clear: "Iraq and Syria are unable to protect their borders, which compels Turkey to deploy troops to the conflict zone. If Turkey leaves [Mosul], DAESH militants, not Iraqi troops, will replace us. If the Iraqi army were to come to Bashiqa, we would greet them with flowers and withdraw from the area."<br /><br />Erdoğan, according to the presidency's written statement, conveyed the same message to Obama on Friday.<br /><br />In plain English, the Turkish government's position is that in light of growing instability in neighboring countries and the emergence of a terror-friendly environment across the southern border, Ankara has developed a new concept of national security. Accordingly, Ankara attempts to neutralize national security threats such as the PKK and DAESH in Syria and Iraq instead of facing the challenge at the border. In Davutoğlu's words, "We need to create a safe environment in Northern Iraq to keep DAESH and the PKK under control in order to maintain security at home." Having pushed for the creation of a DAESH-free zone in northern Syria, Ankara now demands similar action in Northern Iraq to keep itself and the KRG safe. The case of Mosul indicates that Ankara would like Turkish troops to enforce a safe zone in which peshmerga forces and other anti-DAESH groups will receive training.Davutoğlu maintains that "Turkey's border security starts across the border." This statement, it would appear, lies at the heart of this new concept of national security.<span class="lastDot"></span>

When Turkey downed a Russian jet violating its airspace, hardly anyone thought that Moscow would turn the affair into a hot conflict. Instead, the Kremlin opened a war of nerves against the Turkish government in an effort to mount diplomatic, economic and psychological pressure on Ankara to retreat. The ultimate goal of Moscow's game plan is to prevent Turkey from protecting its interests on the ground.<br /><br />The Kremlin fired the opening salvo, claiming that Turkey was buying oil from DAESH, a terrorist organization that Ankara is actively fighting, in an effort to discredit the Turkish government. Neither a series of images published by the Russian Ministry of Defense nor the argumentation, however, was persuasive for the international community. As a matter of fact, Turkey's allies, including the United States, have called Russia's claims absolutely crazy.<br /><br />At the same time, the Russians have taken their ongoing assaults against the moderate rebels in Syria, which they believe to receive support from Turkey, to the next level and started providing weapons and ammunition to the Democratic Union Party (PYD) and its armed People's Protection Units (YPG), which Ankara considers a national security threat. In recent weeks, Moscow's efforts to prevent the Turkish military from interfering in the Syrian civil war jeopardized a joint Turkish-American plan to push DAESH militants away from the border since Turkey has not been able to participate in anti-DAESH airstrikes across the border.<br /><br />According to security sources, Ankara intends to resume anti-DAESH operations soon. Speaking on condition of anonymity, a senior government official said that Turkey has completed preparations to remove DAESH terrorists from Jarabulus. "Even if the Turkish Air Force won't be able to assist the moderate rebels, long-range artillery weapons will strike DAESH positions around Jarabulus," the official said.<br /><br />In addition to Soviet-style propaganda and attacks on the moderate rebels, the Russian government has sought to strong-arm Turkey's neighbors into putting diplomatic pressure on Ankara. A particularly striking manifestation of Moscow's strategy was the Mosul row between Turkey and Iraq. On Dec. 4, Turkish media reported that Turkey deployed 1,200 troops accompanied by tanks and armored vehicles to Bashiqa, an Iraqi town on the outskirts of DAESH-held Mosul. At Bashiqa, the Turkish military had been training Arab, Kurdish and Turkmen forces since 2014. More than 2,500 peshmerga fighters, trained by Turkey, played an influential role in the liberation of Sinjar. The central government in Baghdad, furthermore, knew about the training program. Within hours, Iraqi officials called the incursion a violation of Iraq's sovereignty rights and urged Ankara to withdraw its forces from the area. The Turkish government, in turn, saw Baghdad's strong reaction to something they already knew of as a sign of Russian and Iranian pressure. Moscow's futile attempt to get the U.N. Security Council involved without even notifying Baghdad, it goes without saying, supported Turkey's initial assessment.<br /><br />Finally, Moscow has been trying to impose limited economic sanctions on Turkey as part of this war of nerves. Although the Kremlin stopped the import of agricultural products from Turkish suppliers, key projects such as natural gas trade and the construction of nuclear plants remain untouched. According to official estimates, Turkish producers have lost $9 billion due to the sanctions. Oddly enough, Russia stands to lose the same amount of money.<br /><br />The war of nerves continues on multiple fronts, but the one clear thing is that Russia's aggressive policies might cost Turkey some money in the short term, but Moscow stands to lose more over the long term.<span class="lastDot"></span>

On Nov. 29, I traveled to Brussels as part of a press delegation accompanying Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu. An important item on the prime minister's agenda was a series of meetings with NATO officials. Needless to say, the event was a perfect opportunity to hear what Turkey's top officials thought about the downing of a Russian jet and the future of Turkish-Russian relations.<br /><br />First of all, it might be a good idea to provide a general picture. Since the downing of a Russian jet, the Turkish government has made a series of statements to convey the message that Turkey merely followed the rules of military engagement to protect its sovereignty rights. We have nothing against Russia, Turkey's leaders have repeatedly said. The Russians, in turn, have been anything but diplomatic: At this time, the entire Russian government from President Vladimir Putin to university chancellors are exploiting the Russian jet crisis to reach diplomatic goals. In recent weeks, Moscow not only introduced economic sanctions against Turkey but also arbitrarily detained Turkish students and business people. In light of the most recent developments, there are serious questions about the future of Turkish-Russian relations.<br /><br />Obviously, nothing will ever be the same. One of the main reasons for the worsening relations is that the Turkish government doesn't believe that the Kremlin is acting in good faith. A number of government officials indicated that Moscow came up with a complete road map prior to interfering in the Syrian civil war. Part of the game plan, they argue, has been to make Turkey uncomfortable. Moving forward, the Russians want to keep Syrian President Bashar Assad in power and, at the very least, keep the Latakia area under control. Keeping in mind that Washington has İncirlik and Britain controls a military base in Cyprus, the Russians clearly don't want to lose the Tartus Naval Base.<br /><br />Ultimately, Russia had two short-term goals: (1) To wipe out the Turkmen community in northwestern Syria in an effort to cut the supply routes to the moderate rebels. Ahead of the Russian jet crisis, Moscow was reluctant to antagonize Ankara by directly targeting the rebels. The Russians, likewise, were worried that deploying the S-400 air defense system would trigger a strong response from NATO. By violating Turkish airspace and losing a military aircraft, Moscow has created a perfect opportunity to move forward.<br /><br />At the same time, the Russians have been doing everything in their power to help the Assad regime reclaim parts of Syria ahead of the Vienna process, which will hypothetically kick off on Jan. 1. In other words, Mr. Putin's threats against Turkey might become less frequent after New Year's Eve. Keeping in mind that Russia won't impose economic sanctions until Jan. 1, the Kremlin might be assuming that bilateral ties may become stronger once the Syrian regime scores some points on the ground.<br /><br />The situation, however, might prove more complex than what the Russian government imagines. Even if things get better after Jan. 1, Turkish-Russian relations will never fully recover. Although a government official said that the two countries were able to patch things up after the Georgian war, Ankara is bound to see Russia as a country which knowingly hurt its interests in Syria. Nowadays, there are strong signs that Turkey is willing to see its relations with Russia from a NATO-oriented perspective. If Ankara stops viewing Moscow as a partner, the Russians will have lost a valuable neighbor which was willing to offer them a way to break the Western-imposed isolation following the Ukrainian crisis. All Turkey needs to do, in turn, is to diversify its energy supply - an issue that the Turkish government works hard to address without further delay. The most recent agreements with Azerbaijan to complete TANAP by 2018 and a new LGG deal with Qatar indicate that Turkey wants to reduce Russia's share in its energy market. The rest, as a senior official said, is Russia's problem.<span class="lastDot"></span>

When Russia intervened in the Syrian civil war by launching airstrikes against the regime's opponents in September, hardly anyone thought something bad was going to happen. By deploying troops and the Russian Air Forces to Syria ahead of the Vienna talks, the Kremlin wanted to strengthen Syrian President Bashar Assad's hand and, at the very least, carve out a piece of land for the regime around Latakia - with Russian military bases on it. Under the pretext of fighting DAESH, the Russians have since been targeting a number of moderate rebel organizations with no known ties to the terrorists.<br /><br />Just like in Ukraine, the Russian military has been like a bull in a china shop. Facing no challenge from either the United States or the European Union, the Kremlin has developed a mafia-style foreign policy, which puts military power above everything else, and proceeded to follow its own rules without interruption. Encouraged by a sense of impunity, Moscow had been trying to strongarm a number of Eastern European countries and put pressure on international organizations. In the end, an overdose of self-confidence led the Kremlin to hurt the interests of all countries with which Russia pretended to work closely: Not only has the Russian military been targeting moderate rebels backed by Turkey and the United States but also Russian fighter jets did repeatedly violate Turkey's airspace. The initial transgressions took place on Oct. 4-5 and left the Turkish government notably frustrated. (I discussed Turkey's response in greater detail on Oct. 12 and noted that Turkey had officially told the Russians that it would respond to future violations in accordance with the rules of military engagement.) At the time, a Turkish government official, recalling the recent downing of an unmanned aircraft, had warned that "we cannot avoid similar incidents in the future unless Russia abandons its policy of aggression."<br /><br />For Turkey, the Kremlin's most unsettling move took place last week, as the Turkmen community in northwestern Syria's Bayırbucak region came under fire by Russian jets and the Assad regime's ground forces. Ironically, there were no DAESH militants in the area, where Moscow unconvincingly claimed to combat the terrorists. According to Turkish officials, the Russian campaign sought to accomplish two goals:<br /><br />(1) To secure the Khmeimim Air Base, the primary hub for Moscow's air bombardments. Turkey believes that the moderate rebels' advances toward Latakia triggered a heavy response from Russia, which has since reinforced the base with S-400 missiles.<br /><br />(2) To prevent a joint military operation by Turkey and the United States against DAESH positions near Jarabulus. Instead, the Kremlin would like to facilitate the capture of Jarabulus by the Democratic Union Party (PYD) forces to help create a direct route to the Mediterranean.<br /><br />In an interesting turn of events, Turkey downed an unidentified warplane which ignored at least 10 warnings and proceeded to violate the Turkish airspace on Nov. 24. Within hours, it became clear that the downed jet was a Russian Sukhoi Su-24, whose picture appeared on the front page of every major newspaper around the world. As pundits were busy debating whether or not the incident might lead to a Russo-Turkish war, the U.S., EU and NATO sided with Turkey - which, they said, had documented that the plane was shot down in its airspace.In the meantime, escalating tensions between Ankara and Moscow reached new heights as Russian President Vladimir Putin urged Turkey to apologize for the shootdown, offer compensation and discipline the Turkish pilots who downed the violator. In response, the Turkish government adopted a rational and diplomatic approach to stand its ground and turn down the request for an apology. "We won't apologize to Russia. Instead, those who violated our airspace should offer an apology," Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan told CNN International's Becky Anderson on Thursday. Turkish government officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, maintained that Turkey merely protected its sovereignty rights by downing the Russian jet. Meanwhile, public statements by the Turkish leaders indicate that the country would like to leave the incident behind and de-escalate the situation. At a time when certain Russian universities have decided to terminate their contracts with Turkish colleges, a Russian politician has called on Putin to "destroy Istanbul with a nuclear missile strike." Having hardly launched any airstrikes against DAESH in Syria, the Kremlin has even accused Turkey, a country fighting the terrorists alongside the U.S., of supporting DAESH. Unfortunately, Moscow's response to the shootdown has been nothing short of uncontrollably irrational.The reason behind the Kremlin's frenzy is a thinly-veiled secret: For the first time since 1952, a NATO member has downed a Russian aircraft. For the first time since the Russian intervention in the Syrian civil war, a Russian soldier has lost his life. And for the first time in a long time, a country has reminded the Russians that there are certain limits to their power. As Turkey downed the Su-24, Moscow's impunity came to an abrupt end - which, almost overnight, led to a new wave of criticism toward Russia in a number of countries bullied by the Kremlin. One would hope that Moscow will draw important lessons from the affair and avoid new adventures in the Middle East.<span class="lastDot"></span>
